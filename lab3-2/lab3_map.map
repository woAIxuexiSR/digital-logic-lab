Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:178 - Clock buffer BUFGMUX symbol "physical_group_XLXN_27/XLXI_9"
   (output signal=XLXN_27) does not drive clock loads. Driving only non-clock
   loads with a clock buffer will cause ALL of the dedicated clock routing
   resources for this buffer to be wasted. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I1 of XLXI_6/XLXI_1/XLXI_12
   Pin I1 of XLXI_4/XLXI_1/XLXI_12
   Pin I1 of XLXI_3/XLXI_1/XLXI_12
   Pin I0 of XLXI_5/XLXI_1/XLXI_12

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_4/XLXI_1/CLK1 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_5/XLXI_1/CLK1 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.57

Peak Memory Usage:  335 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
